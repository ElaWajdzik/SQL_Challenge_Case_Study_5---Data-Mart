Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?

- `region`
- `platform`
- `age_band`
- `demographic`
- `customer_type`

Do you have any further recommendations for Danny‚Äôs team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?

First of all, it would be good to compare the total sales over a 12-week period in 2020 and calculate the percentage variance between the `before` and `after` periods. The total difference between these two intervals is 152.3 million, representing a 2.14% reduction in sales. To identify the areas with the most significant negative impact, I focused on records with a percentage variance of less than -2% and where the value of the difference represents a significant percentage of the total variance.

I checked every area using the same query, changing the column name in two places to group by the respective column.

```sql
WITH clean_weekly_sales_12_weeks AS (
--part of data 12 weeks after and before deployment the change (2020-06-15)
	SELECT *,
		CASE 
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 12 AND 23 THEN 'before'
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 24 AND 35 THEN 'after'
		END AS period
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	--filter the date which include in after or before period
	WHERE week_number BETWEEN (24 - 12) AND (24 + 12 - 1)
	AND calendar_year = 2020
	)

SELECT
	region,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2))) AS after_total_sales_mln,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2))) AS before_total_sales_mln,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2)))
		- SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2)))  AS sales_variance_mln,
	CAST(
		(SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) * 100.0 / 
			SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))) - 100
		AS NUMERIC(5,2)) AS variance_percentage
FROM clean_weekly_sales_12_weeks
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) * 100.0 / 
			SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) - 100;
 ```


Compare the periods across different `region`


Compare the periods across different `platform`


Compare the periods across different `age_band`


Compare the periods across different `demographic`


Compare the periods across different `customer_type`
