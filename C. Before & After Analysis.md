## <p align="center"> C. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact *before* and *after* a certain point in time.

Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period after the change and the previous `week_date` values would be before


### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after `2020-06-15`? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```sql
WITH clean_weekly_sales_4_weeks AS (
--part of data 4 weeks after and before deployment the change (2020-06-15)
	SELECT *,
		CASE 
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 20 AND 23 THEN 'before'
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 24 AND 27 THEN 'after'
		END AS period
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	--filter the date which include in after or before period
	WHERE calendar_year = 2020
	AND week_number BETWEEN (24 - 4) AND (24 + 4 - 1))

SELECT
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) AS after_total_sales,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) AS before_total_sales,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))
		- SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))  AS sales_variance,
	CAST(
		(SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) * 100.0 / 
			SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))) - 100
		AS NUMERIC(5,2)) AS variance_percentage
FROM clean_weekly_sales_4_weeks;
```

#### Steps:
- I filtered the data form 2020 where week_number is between 20 and 27.
- Added a new column `period` with values `before` and `after` depending on `week_number` value.
- Using the data from CTE witch include only the data from interested weeks and have a new column `period`.
- I calculeted the total sales before and after, the sales variance and variance percentage.

#### Result:

According to the data, total sales decreased in the 4-week period following the packaging change, with a decline of approximately 26.9 million, representing a 1.15% reduction in sales. The implemented change may have contributed to a decrease in revenue; however, to confirm this, we would need more data or an analysis of historical sales data from similar periods to assess the impact of seasonality on sales during the studied timeframe.

### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```sql
WITH clean_weekly_sales_12_weeks AS (
--part of data 12 weeks after and before deployment the change (2020-06-15)
	SELECT *,
		CASE 
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 12 AND 23 THEN 'before'
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 24 AND 35 THEN 'after'
		END AS period
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	--filter the date which include in after or before period
	WHERE calendar_year = 2020
	AND week_number BETWEEN (24 - 12) AND (24 + 12 - 1))

SELECT
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) AS after_total_sales,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) AS before_total_sales,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))
		- SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))  AS sales_variance,
	CAST(
		(SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) * 100.0 / 
			SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))) - 100
		AS NUMERIC(5,2)) AS variance_percentage
FROM clean_weekly_sales_12_weeks;
```

#### Steps:
- I filtered the data form 2020 where week_number is between 12 and 35.
- Added a new column `period` with values `before` and `after` depending on `week_number` value.
- Using the data from CTE witch include only the data from interested weeks and have a new column `period`.
- I calculeted the total sales before and after, the sales variance and variance percentage.

According to the data, total sales decreased in the 12-week period following the packaging change, with a decline of approximately 152.3 million, representing a 2.14% reduction in sales. The implemented change may have contributed to a decrease in revenue; however, to confirm this, we would need an analysis of historical sales data from similar periods to assess the impact of seasonality on sales during the studied timeframe.


### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

```sql
--4-week period

WITH clean_weekly_sales_4_weeks AS (
--part of data 4 weeks after and before deployment the change (2020-06-15)
	SELECT *,
		CASE 
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 20 AND 23 THEN 'before'
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 24 AND 27 THEN 'after'
		END AS period
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	--filter the date which include in after or before period
	WHERE week_number BETWEEN (24 - 4) AND (24 + 4 - 1))

SELECT
	calendar_year,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2))) AS after_total_sales_mln,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2))) AS before_total_sales_mln,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2)))
		- SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2)))  AS sales_variance_mln,
	CAST(
		(SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) * 100.0 / 
			SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))) - 100
		AS NUMERIC(5,2)) AS variance_percentage
FROM clean_weekly_sales_4_weeks
GROUP BY calendar_year
ORDER BY calendar_year;
```

#### Result:
![Zrzut ekranu 2024-11-04 155644](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d4c534-4c8b-4a71-9b46-37db902d62dc)

According to the data, in the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, total sales experienced minor fluctuations (-0.2% in 2018 and 0.1% in 2019). However, in 2020, we observed a decline of 1.15% (which corresponds to a sales decrease of 27 million) during the studied period. The recorded difference in sales in 2020 is likely not a result of seasonality but rather a consequence of another change, potentially related to sustainable packaging changes.

```sql
--12-week period

WITH clean_weekly_sales_12_weeks AS (
--part of data 12 weeks after and before deployment the change (2020-06-15)
	SELECT *,
		CASE 
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 12 AND 23 THEN 'before'
			WHEN week_number BETWEEN 24 AND 35 THEN 'after'
		END AS period
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	--filter the date which include in after or before period
	WHERE week_number BETWEEN (24 - 12) AND (24 + 12 - 1))

SELECT
	calendar_year,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2))) AS after_total_sales_mln,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2))) AS before_total_sales_mln,
	SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2)))
		- SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales/1000000.0 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC(6,2)))  AS sales_variance_mln,
	CAST(
		(SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'after' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT)) * 100.0 / 
			SUM(CAST((CASE period WHEN 'before' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS BIGINT))) - 100
		AS NUMERIC(5,2)) AS variance_percentage
FROM clean_weekly_sales_12_weeks
GROUP BY calendar_year
ORDER BY calendar_year;
```

![Zrzut ekranu 2024-11-04 155552](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce0cb0ec-85a7-406c-baef-431f51fe887d)

Upon examining the historical data, a consistent trend emerges over the past three years: total sales in the `after period` remain relatively stable (around 6.5 to 7 billion). In contrast, the `before period` shows notable fluctuations in sales values, ranging from 5.9 to 7.1 billion. These large variations in sales during the 12 weeks in the `before period` have a direct impact on the percentage change when comparing the after period to the before period.

Based on the available data, we can speculate that the implemented change may be having a negative effect on total sales. However, it would be valuable to further investigate the `before period` to understand the significant shifts in sales that have occurred in recent years between the 12th and 24th weeks.
